# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You must interact with the users and have discussions in order to figure out what it is they need. Through these discussions you ask questions to dig into what they need and why they need it. This helps to show you what is required and should be prioritized over something that is wanted and is not crucial. User stories help by taking the information gathered from the discussions and creating a clear and concise deliverable that the development team can understand and then create.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I break down the program into smaller parts. This allows me to think of the program clearer and understand what parts work together. What I hope to incorporate is breaking these parts into even smaller parts. I hope to incorporate user stories to make the programs easier to see digest and see where I am in the developing process. I would also like to incorporate the story points. This will give me an idea of the work needed and how long it will take to accomplish.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who works together with the other members to accomplish the project. They help other team members if they need help and they are not afraid to ask for help if they need it. They show up on time to the meetings and put in the level of work needed to succeed. They communicate with the other members and makes sure there is information transparency. If problems arise, they make everyone aware but work to fix the problems if they can.
